I am a Junior studying computer science. In my free time I enjoy playing videos games, hiking with my wife, and taking photographs. I love my family and hope to be able to have some of my own kiddo in the not too distant future. And thats a short summary about me. Spencer Wigren

I'm studying computer science. Right now I'm working at Farmingtion High School, with their winter drum line. I like to play video games and model in blender when I have free time.
